title: Advanced IMCore features
description: "Read receipts, typing indicators, IMCore status, and Messages launch control — opt-in, SIP-disabled, and increasingly limited on macOS 26."
---

Most `imsg` workflows — `chats`, `history`, `watch`, `send`, `react` — are explicitly designed to *not* require any private framework or process injection. They go through Messages.app's published surfaces (SQLite, AppleScript, file events) and need only the documented permissions covered in [Permissions](permissions.md).

The features documented here are the exception. They drive Messages.app from the inside via a helper dylib injected into the Messages process, and they trigger several macOS protections you have to disable to use them.

You almost certainly do not need any of this for normal use.

## What's in scope

- `imsg read --to <handle> [--chat-id <id>]` — mark a chat as read.
- `imsg typing --to <handle> [--duration 5s] [--stop true]` — show or stop the typing indicator.
- `imsg launch [--dylib <path>] [--kill-only] [--force]` — launch Messages.app with the helper dylib injected.
- `imsg status` — read-only IMCore bridge status.
- `imsg name-photo status|share --chat <guid>` — inspect the native offer
  eligibility or explicitly share your Messages Name & Photo with a chat.
- `imsg send-rich --chat <guid> --reply-to <message-guid> --file <path>` —
  sends a threaded reply with an attachment through the bridge.
- `imsg send-rich --chat <guid> --url <url>` — sends an Apple URL
  preview balloon through the bridge. URL mode is iMessage-only and does not
  combine with text, files, effects, subjects, replies, or formatting.
- `imsg send-attachment --chat <guid> --file <path> [--reply-to <message-guid>]` —
  prefers the bridge for private attachment sends, with AppleScript fallback
  for normal files when no reply target is requested.
- `imsg send-sticker --chat <guid> --file <path> [--attach-to <message-guid>]
  [--target-part <index>]` — sends a validated sticker-attributed image transfer
  through the bridge.
- `imsg poll send|vote|unvote ...` — create native Polls balloons and cast or
  remove selections.

Rich-link metadata and preview images are fetched from the local Mac by the
`imsg` process before the bridge request; the injected Messages helper performs
no network access. Preparation has one eight-second deadline, and accepted image
decode/staging is capped at 2 MiB, 4096×4096, and 16 megapixels. Lookup failure
degrades to a metadata-only card. If the bridge cannot construct the card, the
command fails without sending the URL as a plain message.

## Why they're separate

These features depend on private IMCore APIs that aren't reachable from outside the Messages process. To touch them, `imsg` injects a small helper dylib into Messages.app via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. Homebrew installs that helper when the release archive includes it; source builds can create it with `make build-dylib`.

That injection requires three things to be true on the target machine:

1. **SIP disabled.** System Integrity Protection blocks `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` into protected system apps. Without disabling SIP, the launch step refuses to proceed.
2. **Library validation off.** macOS 26 (Tahoe) tightened library validation; even with SIP off, a dylib that isn't signed against Messages' team identifier can be rejected.
3. **No private-entitlement gate.** macOS 26 also added `imagent` entitlement checks that can refuse direct IMCore clients regardless of injection success.

You should expect at least one of these gates to be active on a current macOS install. The features are documented because they remain useful for research, testing, and CI — not because they're stable user-facing functionality.

## Building and launching

```bash
imsg launch        # launches Messages.app with the dylib injected
imsg status        # confirms the bridge is up
```

Source installs need one extra step first:

```bash
make build-dylib   # produces .build/release/imsg-bridge-helper.dylib (arm64e)
```

Resolved native replies use ordinary message construction with a native thread
identifier, so their outgoing bubbles remain visible in Messages. Maintainers
can run `make test-native-replies` to check plain, threaded, and multipart text
construction against the installed IMCore framework. The probe uses synthetic
messages without opening `chat.db`, resolving a conversation, or sending. It
checks construction, not recipient delivery, and also runs in macOS CI.

`imsg launch` refuses to inject when SIP is enabled. There's no override.

After a CLI upgrade, `imsg launch` replaces an injected helper whose release
version differs from the CLI or predates version reporting. Matching helpers
are reused; `--force` restarts Messages even when the version matches. Version
checks and replacement share the launch lock, so concurrent launches reuse the
first caller's updated helper. Standalone `make build-dylib` builds generate
the helper and CLI version markers from `version.env` before compilation.

Library clients can still call or store the synchronous and asynchronous
`MessagesLauncher.ensureRunning()` methods as no-argument functions. The
version-aware overloads also accept `expectedHelperVersion` and `force`.

`imsg status` shows the running helper version and warns on a mismatch.
JSON output includes `helper_version` when reported and
`helper_version_mismatch` when it differs from the CLI or a successful probe
omits the version. Status remains read-only; run `imsg launch` to update the helper.

Each container has one active helper. Additional instances using the same updated
helper wait without changing readiness or consuming requests, then take over
when the owner exits. The owner also restores a ready marker removed during
launcher cleanup. The `.imsg-bridge-owner.lock` file is permanent; do not delete it
while a helper is running.

Older injected helpers do not participate in ownership locking. After upgrading,
run `imsg launch` to replace them before using advanced operations. A patched
helper cannot exclude an older helper that is still running.

Launch waits up to 15 seconds for the bridge-ready file. On a host with slower
cold starts, extend that wait for the CLI or its supervisor:

```bash
IMSG_LAUNCH_READY_TIMEOUT=60 imsg launch --json
```

The value is a positive number of seconds, capped at 600. Invalid or non-positive
values use the 15-second default. This also applies to library and bridge calls
that launch Messages. A timeout still returns an error: Messages may still be
starting, so check `imsg status` before relaunching. The timeout setting does not
bypass the SIP or permission checks.

`imsg status` is read-only. It does not auto-launch or auto-inject. Run `imsg launch` first.

To revert: re-enable SIP from Recovery mode (`csrutil enable`), then reboot.

## Read receipts

```bash
imsg read --to "+14155551212"
imsg read --to "+14155551212" --chat-id 42
imsg read --to "+14155551212" --chat-identifier "iMessage;+;chat..."
imsg read --to "+14155551212" --chat-guid "iMessage;+;chat..."
```

Marks the chat for that handle as read. Useful when you want a programmatic agent to clear the unread counter in Messages without spawning a UI action.

## Typing indicators

```bash
imsg typing --to "+14155551212" --duration 5s
imsg typing --to "+14155551212" --duration 30s --service imessage
imsg typing --to "+14155551212" --stop true
```

Displays or hides the "typing" bubble on the recipient's device.

`--service` accepts `imessage`, `sms`, or `auto`. The IMCore typing chat lookup normalizes across `iMessage`, `SMS`, and `any` prefixes so the same handle works on either service.

On macOS 26, typing indicators frequently fail with an entitlement error. `imsg` reports this as an advanced-feature setup error rather than a misleading "chat not found" — see `CHANGELOG.md` 0.6.0 for the issue history.

## Status

```bash
imsg status
imsg status --json
```

Reports whether Messages is running, whether the helper dylib is loaded, and whether the IMCore bridge is responding. Read-only; safe to run on any machine.

When the bridge isn't loaded, `status` prints the reason rather than attempting to fix it. Use `imsg launch` if you want to bring it up.

## Messages Name & Photo

```bash
imsg name-photo status --chat 'iMessage;-;+15551234567'
imsg name-photo share --chat 'iMessage;-;+15551234567'
```

This is Apple Messages' **Share Name & Photo** feature, not a vCard or Contacts
attachment. `status` is read-only and reports `should_offer`, the same advisory
eligibility Messages uses for its native prompt. A false value does not prove
that sharing previously happened.

`share` is a privacy-sensitive mutation: it requests that Messages send your
personal nickname/photo to every participant in the selected chat. The bridge
reports `has_personal_nickname: false` and refuses the share when Messages has
no personal Name & Photo configured, instead of claiming that it sent one. The
bridge returns `requested: true` only after invoking the version-gated private API; it
does not claim receiver delivery. Agents must not invoke it without an explicit
user request and a confirmed destination.

## Launching Messages with a custom dylib

```bash
imsg launch --dylib /path/to/custom.dylib
imsg launch --kill-only           # quit Messages without launching
imsg launch --json                # machine-readable launch result
```

`--kill-only` is the inverse: it tears Messages down (to drop a stale injection) without relaunching.

## When to use any of this

The honest answer for most readers: **don't**. The macOS 26 limits make these features unstable in production. They're useful when:

- You're doing macOS / Messages.app research.
- You're running CI inside a controlled VM with SIP disabled by configuration.
- You need a typing-indicator demo on a single hand-tuned machine.

For agent integrations, prefer the standard CLI surfaces (`send`, `react`, `watch`). They cover the realistic interaction surface without touching SIP.

`send-attachment --transport auto` is the one bridge command that can still
complete without a running bridge for normal file attachments: it stages the
file under Messages' attachments directory, tries the dylib path first, then
falls back to AppleScript. `--audio` remains bridge-only because AppleScript
cannot preserve the private audio-message flag.

`send-sticker` is always bridge-only and iMessage-only. It accepts PNG/APNG,
GIF, and JPEG images up to 500 KiB, 618x618 pixels, 100 frames, and 25 million
total decoded pixels. Inputs must be regular files; pipes, devices, and paths
through symlinks (including `link/../image.png`) are rejected before sending.
It reads every frame without following symlinks and
stages a private snapshot under Messages' attachments directory. Content
bytes—not the filename—define sticker identity. `--attach-to`
optionally associates the sticker with an exact bubble part; `--target-part`
defaults to `0` and is invalid without a target. Check `imsg status --json`:
standalone sends require `selectors.stickerSend`, while attached stickers also
require `selectors.stickerAttach`.
