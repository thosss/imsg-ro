description: "Attachment metadata, resolved paths, and optional model-friendly conversion for CAF audio and GIF images."
---

Reading attachments reports metadata and paths without modifying the originals. Optional conversion creates cached variants for CAF audio and GIF images. Sending stages a private copy for Messages to read, as described below.

## Reading attachments

```bash
imsg history --chat-id 42 --attachments --json
imsg watch   --chat-id 42 --attachments --json
```

Every message JSON object contains an `attachments` array. CLI `history` and
`watch` JSON preserve their historical behavior of populating attachment
metadata even without `--attachments`; that flag controls human-readable
display. RPC read methods populate the array only when their documented
`attachments` flag is true. Otherwise it is empty. Per-attachment fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `filename` | string | Stored filename inside Messages' attachments dir. |
| `transfer_name` | string | Original filename as sent. |
| `uti` | string | Apple Uniform Type Identifier. |
| `mime_type` | string | Best-effort MIME from UTI. |
| `total_bytes` | int | Size in bytes. |
| `is_sticker` | bool | True for sticker-pack attachments. |
| `missing` | bool | True when the file couldn't be located on disk. |
| `original_path` | string | Resolved absolute path under `~/Library/Messages/Attachments/`. |
| `converted_path` | string | Set only with `--convert-attachments`; see below. |
| `converted_mime_type` | string | Set only with `--convert-attachments`. |

When an attachment is referenced in `chat.db` but the underlying file has been pruned (Messages can age out big files), `missing` is `true` and `original_path` may be empty.

## Converted variants

```bash
imsg history --chat-id 42 --attachments --convert-attachments --json
imsg watch   --chat-id 42 --attachments --convert-attachments --json
```

This adds `converted_path` and `converted_mime_type` to attachments where conversion is supported:

- **CAF audio → M4A.** Messages' on-device voice memos are stored as CAF; most LLMs and downstream tools want M4A.
- **GIF image → first-frame PNG.** Useful when a static thumbnail is enough for downstream models.

Originals are never modified. Converted files live alongside in a cache directory and are reused on subsequent reads.

`--convert-attachments` requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. If `ffmpeg` is missing, the command still succeeds — `converted_path` is simply omitted from the output and the original metadata is unchanged.

`brew install ffmpeg` to enable.

## Sending attachments

```bash
imsg send --to "+14155551212" --file ~/Desktop/photo.jpg
imsg send --to "Jane Appleseed" --file ~/Desktop/voice.m4a
imsg send --chat-id 42 --file ~/Desktop/note.pdf
```

`--file` accepts any regular file. Audio files (`.m4a`, `.caf`, `.aiff`, …) ride the same code path as images and documents.

Before invoking AppleScript, `imsg` stages the file under `~/Library/Messages/Attachments/imsg/`. Messages reads attachments from inside its own attachments directory more reliably than from `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads`, particularly under newer macOS sandboxing.

The staged copies live under `imsg/`, distinct from Messages' own subdirectories, and are not pruned automatically. Clear them periodically if disk space matters.

For bridge-backed threaded replies, use `send-rich --file` or
`send-attachment --reply-to`:

```bash
imsg send-rich --chat 'iMessage;-;+15551234567' \
  --reply-to <messageGuid> --text "here it is" --file ~/Desktop/photo.jpg
imsg send-attachment --chat 'iMessage;-;+15551234567' \
  --reply-to <messageGuid> --file ~/Desktop/photo.jpg
```

### Native voice messages

```bash
imsg send-attachment --chat 'iMessage;-;+15551234567' \
  --file ~/Desktop/speech.mp3 --audio
```

`--audio` sends a native voice message through the bridge. Before dispatch,
imsg converts a securely staged copy to mono 24 kHz Opus in a CAF container,
using macOS's built-in `/usr/bin/afconvert`. No ffmpeg installation is needed.
This applies to macOS-supported audio inputs, including MP3, M4A, WAV and CAF;
the input extension alone does not determine its codec. Invalid audio or failed
conversion stops the send, without an AppleScript fallback.

Setting the native audio-message flag on an ordinary MP3 is insufficient:
Messages can show a `00:00` bubble that will not play inline even though the
attachment contains valid audio. CAF/Opus preparation gives the native player
the expected audio representation.

The original file is unchanged. The prepared CAF follows the same staged-copy
lifetime described above, because Messages may read it after bridge acknowledgment.
Without `--audio`, audio files remain ordinary attachments and are not transcoded.
RPC `send.attachment` uses the same preparation when `audio`, `is_audio` or
`as_voice` is true. Native voice messages require the bridge; `--transport
applescript` does not support them.

## Why not just copy or upload?

The CLI's contract is "read what's there, send what you give it." Anything beyond that — bulk archival, cloud upload, format conversion at rest — is left to callers, who know their retention and privacy requirements. Conversion is limited to opt-in receive-side variants and the native voice-message representation requested by `--audio`; originals are never rewritten.

If you want a full archive workflow, pipe `--attachments --json` through your own scripts and copy the files out of `~/Library/Messages/Attachments/` yourself.
